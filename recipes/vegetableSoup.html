    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a stockpot pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and tomato paste. Cook, stirring often until the vegetables have softened and the onions are translucent; 8 to 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Simmer for 20 minutes or until the potatoes, and other vegetables are tender. Add the frozen peas and cook for five more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and remove the bay leaves. Stir in the cider vinegar (or lemon juice). Taste and season with more salt, pepper or vinegar. Serve.</li>
