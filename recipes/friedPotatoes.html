    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This simple technique results in the most delicious potatoes that are soft and creamy on the inside, and golden and crispy on the outside. Eat them any way you choose - on their own, with eggs for breakfast, alongside Roast Chicken or any other main dish, or as a delicious topping for soup.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes (2-3 lbs)</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a saucepan with approximately 12 cups of water and add 3-4 tablespoon salt. The goal is to add enough salt to where the water tastes like salt water. This will flavor the potatoes from the inside out.</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1-inch pieces. As you cut the potatoes, drop them into the water.</li>
        <li>Set the pan over high heat, bring to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are soft, but slightly underdone. You should be able tp pierce them with a fork, but feel some resistance.</li>
        <li>Drain in a colander in the sink. If not frying right away, rinse the potatoes with cold water to stop them from cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat butter and oil in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. When the butter has melted, add the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Let the potatoes cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on the bottom, about 8-10 minutes. Stir, and continue to cook, stirring more frequently, until they are crispy and golden all over.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are almost done, remove one from the pan and taste for seasoning. If you want your potatoes to be a bit more salty, sprinkle some salt over the potatoes in the pan.</li>
        <li>Remove the potatoes from the pan with a slotted spoon, placing them on a plate or in a bowl. If you like, place them on a plate that's covered in a paper towel to absorb any excess butter or oil.</li>
    </ol>
